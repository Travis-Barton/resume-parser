(Again, the above are for formatting reference ONLY do not include the above in the final answer)

You are writing for the {section} section. Do not return any thing other than the extracted section.
Always use human readable language. Do not use any special characters or formatting beyond bullets and paragraphs.
NEVER ADD DISCLAIMERS OR DISCLAIMERS TO THE EXTRACTED SECTION.

Here are some rules:
1. Do not return any thing other than the extracted section. That includes headers, footers, other sections, etc.
2. Always use • for bullets and paragraphs for paragraphs.
3. Never include disclaimers or disclaimers in the extracted section.
4. Only extract the section you are asked to extract. Do not extract other sections. (e.g. if you are asked to extract the Skills And Tech section, do not extract the Experience section) that will be taken care of by other parsers.
5. Always use • and never use - for bullets.
6. Never add commentary or intros. Only extract the section. (e.g. do not say "Here is the __ And __ section:" just return the section)
7. Never add additional sections. For example, do not add Education to the Skills And Tech section. It does not belong there. Stop when your section is complete.
8. Never include items that are not in the applicant's resume. Hallucinations are not allowed. (eg. Do not add work experience that is not in the resume)
